vagrant-pe_build
================

0.3.0
-----

2013-08-14

This is a backwards compatible feature and bugfix release.

### User notes:

#### Enhancements:

  * Puppet Enterprise 3 is now fully supported and should have answers that
    work out of the box.
  * (GH-25) The installer for a given platform will be detected based on the
    guest platform, which means that the most precise installer will be used
    instead of the `all` installer.
  * pe_build.download_root now fully supports a local directory with URIs using
    the "file" URI.
  * As part of GH-25 pe_build.suffix defaults to detect, which will auto-select
    the correct installer name

#### Fixes:

  * (GH-23) Removed double expansion of files when running `vagrant pe-build copy`
  * (GH-24) Installer files are downloaded at provision time instead of before
    VMs are constructed

#### Deprecations:

  * Shell scripts run with the `add_step` hash are deprecated and will be
    removed in the next 'major development' release (either 0.4.0, 0.5.0,
    or 1.0.0). This behavior is effectively provided by the `shell` provisioner.

### Developer notes (AKA the gory details):

  * Informational logging has been expanded and is directed to the Vagrant
    internal loggers.
  * Answers file generation has been extracted out of the pe_bootstrap
    provisioner and into an independent class to respect the single
    responsibility principle.
  * New guest capability: "detect_installer" detects the correct installer
    for the given guest platform. Initial supported platforms are Debian,
    Ubuntu, and Redhat.
  * New guest capability: "run_install" extracts the actual command generation
    and execution to install PE on a guest. Initial supported platforms are
    Linux and Solaris.
  * Installer file transfer has been fully extracted from the PEBuild::Archive
    class and pushed into pe_build/transfer classes.
  * File transfer behavior has been abstracted behind the PEBuild::Transfer
    module and the implementing class is selected based on the scheme of the
    requested URI.
  * Almost everything ever has been beaten with the refactor hammer.

### Thanks

  * Thanks to Tom Linkin as always for his awesome work and contributions to
    this plugin.
  * Thanks to Jon Mosco for reporting GH-23.
